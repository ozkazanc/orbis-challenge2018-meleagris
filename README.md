# Orbis Challenge 2018 - Developing an AI

Worked in a team of 2 to construct an Artificial Intelligence under 24 hours, using Python, that played a 2D video game against 3 other AIs in which scoring was based on capturing as much territory as you can by enclosing tiles in the map with your snakeâ€™s body.
Implemented a combination of greedy algorithms and L-Shaped Optimization to finish 7th place out of 71 submissions.
